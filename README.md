# Summary

PaLM (Patient Like Mine) is a web-based platform designed to provide physicians summary of similar cases. By comparing cases, physicians can gain insights into the efficacy of treatments and medications, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This file outlines the project's scope, summarizes user research, and explains design decisions.


# Introduction

As medical professionals face an increasing number of complex patient cases, the need for a comprehensive and efficient tool to compare similar cases has become significant. PaLM aims to address this challenge by providing a search platform for physicians to quickly and easily find similar patient cases, helping them make informed decisions about treatment plans.

# Project Scope

PaLM's primary target audience is physicians, with a focus on providing a user-friendly interface that allows for the input of patient characteristics such as age, gender, medical history, diagnosis, treatments, and more. The platform will analyze and present results based on the entered criteria, enabling physicians to assess the suitability of treatments and medications for their patients.
